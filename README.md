### Running the programs

# Pre Conditions
Make sure that you have python and the following libraries are installed first:
- numpy
- scipy
- opencv
- matplotlib
- tkinter
Make sure that there is a Results folder in the same folder that you are running the algorithm

# Executing a filter
To execute a filter, for example the Nagao-Matsuyama filter, type in 'python Nagao-MatsuyamaFilter.py' and select the image you want to denoise. The image will then be processed by the algorithm and a comparison image will be displayed afterwards and the processed image will also be saved in the Results folder as algorithm-name_output_original_image_name.jpg
